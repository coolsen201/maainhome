# Walkthrough - Artifact Transition to Version2

I have initialized and copied the project artifacts to the `Version2` directory to ensure they are tracked alongside the codebase.

## Changes Made

### Administrative
- Created `task.md`, `implementation_plan.md`, and `walkthrough.md` in the brain directory.
- Copied these files to `/home/senthil/golocal-intercom/Version2/`.

## Verification Results
- Conforming file copies:
  - `Version2/task.md` [x]
  - `Version2/implementation_plan.md` [x]
  - `Version2/walkthrough.md` [x]
